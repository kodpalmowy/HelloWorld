Starting with GitHub.

Hello,

My name is Radek, I'm from Poland and in Feb 2020 I have started my journey with Java.
I graduated from Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology with a masters engineer degree of Shipuilding Faculty.
I always loved working with computers and even in middle school I was a little bit programing in HTML, PHP, pascal.
